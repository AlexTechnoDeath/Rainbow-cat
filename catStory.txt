Once upon a time there was a rainbow cat his name was Pturdis.  Ptudis brought happiness to all the little bois and grills of the world, but she was not happy.  Ironic, she could make others happy, but not herself.  Depression set in, and she loses her colors during the cold winter, then they return with less and less luster.
